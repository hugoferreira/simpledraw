Toy Application for Learning Patterns and Refactoring to Patterns

## How to start

Make sure you have [SBT](http://www.scala-sbt.org/) installed in your system. If you do, 
you don't need to worry about managing dependencies or fetching the JDK. For command line, just
do:

```
sbt compile
sbt run
```

... in the project directory. If you are using IntelliJ, make sure you have both the `SBT` and `JUnit`
plugins installed, and then choose `File->New->Project from existing sources...`. IntelliJ will make 
sure everything is imported accordingly.
